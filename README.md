File Descriptions:

The documents folder contains the concept art file, the wireframes with menus file, and game analysis document.

The PacMan folder is our finished Unity project.

Our Game:

Our game is called Zombie Horde. We based our game off of Pac-Man. The player is in the middle of a zombie apopcoylse in New York, they must collect all of the cans of food and escape the zombies. The goal of the game is to get the most point without dying.

Points System:

Players earn points by collecting the cans of food. Each can adds to the players total points. Once they've collected all of the cans of food in the first level, they move onto the second level. In the second level the zombies are faster. The player wins the game after collecting all of the cans of food in the second level, this means that they have escaped the zombies.

If the player dies in either the first or second level that means that they have been eaten and are taken to the lose screen.

Winning:

A player wins when if they were able to collect all of the cans of food in both the first and second level. If they win they will be taken in the win screen.

Dying:

A player dies when they collide with one of the four zombies. Once this happens, the game immediately ends and brings up the lose screen.

Movement:

Players only control the human avatar. The player can only move up, down, left, and right using the arrow keys on the keyboard. The player can only move on the road and cannot go over any of the buildings or tan boundary.

There is a hole on each side of the map that connect to each other. If the player goes into one of the holes, they will be at the other hole connected to it like a portal. This allows players to easily escape the zombies.
