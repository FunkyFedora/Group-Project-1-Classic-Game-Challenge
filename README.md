Our Game:

Our game is called Zombie Horde. We based our game off of Pac-Man. The player is in the middle of a zombie apopcoylse in New York, they must collect all of the cans of food and escape the zombies. The goal of the game is to get the most point without dying.

Points System:

Players earn points by collecting the cans of food. Each can adds to the players total points. Once they've collected all of the cans of food in the first level, they move onto the second level. In the second level the zombies are faster. The player wins the game after collecting all of the cans of food in the second level, this means that they have escaped the zombies.

If the player dies in either the first or second level, then their final score is based on many cans they were able to collect before being eaten by the zombies.

Dying:

A player dies when they collide with one of the four zombies. Once this happens, the game immediately ends and brings up the lose screen.

Movement:

Players only control the human avatar. The player can only move up, down, left, and right using the arrow keys on the keyboard. The player can only move on the road and cannot go over any of the buildings or tan boundary.
